Generally cutting machine tables are rectangular and wider. To enhance the tooling feasibility, Praxis now rotates the part along the part width after the part is imported such that _wider_ than _taller_.

Use **factory . settings . import** settings to control the rotation parameters. Uncheck the **Rotate flat horizontally** switch to disable the rotation. Set the height cut-off to control the rotation.
