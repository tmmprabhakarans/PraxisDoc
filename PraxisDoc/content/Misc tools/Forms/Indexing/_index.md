When parts with the forming is imported to the Part Library:

-  Praxis recognizes these parts and tags them with the identified 
forms by adding the Part-Form pair to the index. These parts can be 
searched based on tagged forms using the search tool 
(Search behavior is similar to Bend mounts/used tools).

-  To locate parts with _**any**_ forms, change the search field to **Form count** and enter **> 0** (greater than 0) in the search textbox. Alternatively, you can also recall Formed parts saved search for this.
