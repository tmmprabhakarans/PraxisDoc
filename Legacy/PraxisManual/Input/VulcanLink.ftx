(o) Launch Praxis to complete the setup.

Praxis installs *Proteck Dual Head* laser machine to test the Vulcan connection and updates the Vulcan machine automatically. There is no create page in Vulcan as it produces programs created from Praxis when connected.

*Note:* Install the dual head machine manually if the automatic machine installation fails. You will also need to set the Vulcan machine by editing _C:\ProgramData\Metamation\Vulcan\Data\Settings.curl file_ (set MachineId:2230001) after installing the machine in Praxis.
