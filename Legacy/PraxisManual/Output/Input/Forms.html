<h1>Importing Formed Parts</h1>
<p>Praxis adds following enhancements to make it easier to work with parts with formed shapes. </p>
<p>&#9679; It manages the Forms library and keeps them in sync across all Flux instances on Praxis network.</p>
<p>&#9679; When parts with formed shapes are imported, it identifies the Forms and indexes them against the owner parts such that they can be searched later.</p>
<p>&#9679; Auto-extracts the unidentified Forms and adds them to the Forms database so that, later, they can be approved and updated interactively in a batch.</p>
<p>&#9679; Provides two-way search & visualization tools to quickly locate a Form in a part and vice-versa.</p>
<p>&#9679; Routes parts with formed shapes through appropriate cutting-technology machine (punch and combination).</p>
<p>&#9679; Monitors Form database and keeps all parts using them up to date when a forming is updated in Flux forms library.</p>
