<h1>Job</h1>
<p>Praxis uses Jobs to capture and track customer orders. Typically, a job contains a collection of parts with varying quantities, due dates, priority and part order. </p>
<p>New jobs can be </p>
<p>&#9679; Imported from spreadsheets(csv, xlsx)</p>
<p>&#9679; Created from existing parts from the part library</p>
<p>&#9679; Drop parts directly into jobs page and manually provide job parameters</p>
<p>&#9679; From Assemblies.</p>
<h2>Job View</h2>
<p>&#9679; Jobs are displayed in tiles view where each job is displayed with a few basic properties like Job ID, Job reference, Customer name, Total parts etc.</p>
<p>&#9679; A job title also displays ordered parts and quantities as stacked cards. Parts within a job can be scrolled by rolling the mouse wheel over the cards.</p>
<p>&#9679; Jobs can be searched by Job ID, Customer and Job Reference via Search box.</p>
<p>&#9679; Double clicking a tile or pressing <b>Enter</b> key after selecting a tile changes the view into the <b>detail mode</b>.</p>

<h2>Job Details</h2>
<p>&#9679; The details page displays the parts list along with the nested sheets (layouts) if any.</p>
<p>&#9679; Use Up/Down key to change the job being displayed in the details page.</p>
<p>&#9679; Rolling the mouse-wheel over the part-stack highlights the part in part list as well as in the layouts.</p>
<p>&#9679; Selecting a layout highlights the layout as well as all parts nested on the layout in the part list. The highlights automatically go off after a minute.</p>
