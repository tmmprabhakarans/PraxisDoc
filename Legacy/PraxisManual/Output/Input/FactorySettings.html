<h1>Factory Settings</h1>
<p>During the installation, Praxis imports CAM machines from Flux and MetaCAM and builds a routing table with possible workflow routes between. A route is a connection between the two processing stations in the routing view.</p>
<p><img src="img/Route.png" alt="Factory Settings"/></p>
<p>In this view:</p>
<p>● Machines are displayed as processing stations. Each station is drawn with a picture and name.</p>
<p>● The stations are connected to each other with routes indicating a feasible workflow path which a part can take from start-to-finish.</p>
<p>● Station properties can be checked-out by placing the mouse over it.</p>
<p>● The station availability can be edited by clicking on it and toggling the enabled checkbox in the settings inspector dialog</p>
<p>● The inspector can also be used to edit tooling/nesting constraints and settings.</p>
<p>● The modified settings are automatically saved to data:/system/machine.curl file when the Factory dialog closes.</p>
