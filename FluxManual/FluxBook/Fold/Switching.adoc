= Switching to Fold CAM

If you have a 3-D sheet metal model open, you can switch to Fold CAM using the
*Workflow* pane (see the chapter on Part Workflow for more details on this).
Here is one way you could switch to the folding mode:footnote:[Depending on the
options you have in your Flux installation, your workflow panel may look
different.]

* Click on the *workflow* icon in the command bar on the left.
* Click on the *Fold Tech* process node in the workflow panel (see the highlight
  in the image on the right). Optional: click on the auxiliary icon to the
  right of the Fold Tech process node to select a different 
  panel-benderfootnote:[This is for the case that you have multiple panel-benders
  available in your Flux installation.]
* Click the *close* button to close the workflow panel.

Here is a faster way to do this, using the keyboard:

* Press kbd:[W] to open the workflow panel.
* Press kbd:[F] to switch to the folding mode.
* Press kbd:[Esc] to close the workflow panel.

An even faster method can be used if you simply want to use the default folding
machine (the same one that was used the last time)

* Open a part
* Press kbd:[F] to switch to the folding mode

== Generating fold outputs

When you switch to Fold CAM mode, Flux analyzes the part and computes a folding
sequence and assigns tooling. In most cases, the results of this automatic
processing will be a folded part that requires no further intervention.
You can verify this by checking that the fold navigator (described in the
next section) will have no alarm lights on.

If there are no errors, you can click further on the Post-process fold part icon
to generate the NC code for folding. This generates the NC code for the
part, and saves it in a designated location. By clicking on the NC code
icon near the fold outputs node, you can view the NC code.
