= Editing the Unloading
:imagesdir: img

The *Unloading* operation for an automated panel-bender (like TBC-7030 or the TBC-7020)
can be edited by clicking twice on the _unloading_ cell in the navigator on the top. This is
the cell labelled *U*. Clicking twice on this cell (first to select the unloading operation,
and then to open the panel) displays this:

== Unloading Panel

Here are the settings available in the Unloading panel. Depending on the context, only
some of these settings may be visible or editable (for example, if you are not rotating
the part before unloading, the settings related to the rotation center will not appear). 

* The *Rotation* setting on the unloading panel is used to control the rotation of the part
  before unloading. This is measured _relative_ to the last processing side, so a value of 0
  here means the part is unloaded directly without any rotation.
* The *Final Part Z* and *Override* settings control the final Z position of the part-center.
  If there is no _override_, the machine will push the part out as much as possible based on the
  stroke limitation of the X2 or X4 axis (whichever is used to unload the part). You can restrict
  this movement by turning on the Override switch and setting a value for the final part position.
  (Typically, this is done to prevent the part sticking out too much from the front edge of the
  table at the end of the unloading). 
* For small parts, the option of *Back Unloading* may be available (only on the 7030). 
  If this is turned on, the part is pushed back further with the back-face of the manipulator (see
  images below). 
* The *Final Rotor (Z, X)* settings control the Z, X positions of the rotor relative to the part
  center at the _end_ of all the unloading rotations - in other words, at the orientation the part
  is during the discharge. 
* The *Initial Rotor (Z, X)* settings are displayed only if the selected Final Rotor positions require
  two rotations to achieve after the processing of the final side. In this situation, these offsets
  specify the rotor position (relative to the part center) during the first of these two rotations.

Some examples of various unloading cycles will help clarify these settings.

=== Simple unloading with no rotation

The images below show a simple unload cycle with no rotations (the *Rotation* value is set to 0).
In this cycle, the final part position is overridden to stop the part short. Flux normally computes
this necessity for override based on whether the part would stick out too much from the edge of the 
table, but you can subsequently turn it on or off, and then adjust the final delivery position of the
part.

=== Simple cycle with back-unloading

Here is a part where the *Back unloading* cycle is enabled (this is available only for small parts).
In step 2, the part is released by the vacuum gripper, which then backs up behind the part (step 3), 
and then pushes the part closer to the operator using the back-face (step 4).

=== Single rotation of 90 degrees

The example below shows an unloading with a single 90 degree rotation. In step 1, the part is pulled
back after the last bend, and clamped by the rotor. The rotor then rotates the part 90 degrees.
At the end of the rotation (*Step 2*), you can see that the rotor is at the specified 
*Final Rotor (Z,X)* position relative to the part center: *(255, 0)*.

=== 90 degree two-stage rotation

In this example, a 2-stage rotation is required because of the specification of the final rotor
position. 

* In Step 1, the part reaches the *Initial Rotor* position of *0, -255* and is clamped by the 
  rotor. 
* In Step 2, the intermediate rotation position is reached, and the rotor shifts to re-clamp the
  part. 
* In Step 3, the *Final Rotor* position of *0, 254* is reached. 
* The part is then released from the rotor and unloaded towards the user in Step 4.

=== Unloading to a KB40 lane

If a KB40 loader/unloader attachment is fitted, then the option to unload to a specific KB40 lane
is available. You can choose between an automatic lane selection, select one of the *UZ1* or *UZ2* 
lanes (provided the part is narrow enough to fit with the lane / lanes).
