= Editing the Blank-holders
:imagesdir: img

Clicking on the blank-holder brings up the *BH panel* (blank-holder panel). The blank-holder panel 
has the following settings:

image::edit-bh.png[Edit BH,float="right",width=166]

* *Length* is used to select different blank-holder composition length (this is
  displayed if this side uses a split-blank holder composition).
* The *Use ENW* tool check-box is used to enable an ENW tool for processing this
  bend.
* If the *Use ENW* tool setting is turned on, then this list can be used to select
  one of the available ENW tools. This is a part-wide setting, since
  different ENW tools cannot be used for different bends.
* The *Prev* and *Next* button are used to switch between the different bends in the
  part.

As you experiment with various ENW tools, Flux will immediately compute the
collision status of that blank-holder composition for all the bends in the
part, and will update the Fold Navigator status. Thus, it is very simple
to pick a suitable ENW tool by scrolling through this list, since there is
immediate feedback on whether any bends have issues with the selected
tool.
