# Editing a Bend-Op
:imagesdir: img

Some basic settings of a bend operation can can be edited by bring up the *Bend*
panel. To bring up the bend panel, use the bend navigator:

* Click on one of the numbers in the fold navigator to switch to a bend
* Click *again* on the same number to bring up the bend panel for that bend.

The bend panel can be seen alongside. This has some settings and operations for
working on the bend.

* The *Air-gap* input box is used to adjust the air-gap for bending (this is the
  gap between the blade and blank-holders). As the air-gap is adjusted
  from its default value, the Fold Navigator will display a _non-standard
  air-gap_ warning. Collision checking will also be done immedaitely with
  the updated air-gap and you can tune the air-gap to prevent
  collisions. The bending force will also be computed, and if you set
  the air-gap so low that the maximum bending force is exceeded, the
  fold navigator will display this as an error.
* The *P86* setting is used to control the application of additional hold-down
  pressure during the bending cycle
* Use the *Skip Bend* button skip this bend; this bend will not be processed by
  the panel-bender and needs to be processed later (possibly by a
  press-brake).
* The *New Side* button is used to split a side into two separate sides; this
  appears only if you are not editing the first bend in a side. Clicking
  this button splits the side at this bend, and starts a new side. There
  are several reasons you may want to split a side:
  * The side may need to be split into two, and the part may need to be flipped
    between the two sides before processing can be completed.
  * Some bends from another side may need to be completed before the remaining
    bends of this side can be completed. In this case, you can split
    the side, and re-sequence the sides so the bends from the other
    side are inserted in between.
* The *Prev* and *Next* buttons are used to navigate between the different bends in
  the part. (You can also use the _PageUp_ and _PageDown_ keys for this).
* The *Side* button is used to navigate up from this bend op to the containing
  side. Clicking this button displays the Bend Side panel (described
  below) which can be used to perform some operations on the entire
  bending side (or section).

If this bend has been skipped, these settings are not displayed; there is only
an *Unskip Bend* button to bring the bend back into processing.
