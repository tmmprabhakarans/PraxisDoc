= Editing Operations

There are various _panels_ used to edit the settings of a 
bend operation, the blade settings, the blank-holder settings etc. Most of these panels 
are accessed simply by clicking on the appropriate element in 3D display - for example, 
to edit the blank-holder settings, just click on the
blank-holder.
