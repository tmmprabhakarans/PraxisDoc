There are a few settings and operations connected to an entire bending _side_ (as
opposed to a single bend _operation_). These are accessed by opening the
*Side Panel*:

* Open a Bend panel (by clicking twice on a number in the Fold Navigator). Then
  click on the *Side* button to open the Side panel for the side that
  contains that bend.
* Hold down kbd:[Ctrl] and click on a number in the fold navigator to open the
  side panel for that side.

The side panel looks like the one shown alongside (the actual set of options
available in the Edit Sequence popup may be different, depending on the
part).

* Click the *Flip Side* button to flip the entire side upside down. This will
  cause the blades, blank-holders and part-handling to be recomputed
  immediately.
* Click the *Edit Sequence* button to bring up a sub-menu that shows the possibly
  sequence shuffling that you could do with this side. In the picture
  above, we are working with a part that has a side sequence like L1 L2
  C1 C2, and we have selected the side L2. The possible sequence choices
  are explained below:
  * *<< L2 earlier* shifts the side L2 earlier, leading to a sequence that would be
    L2 L1 C1 C2 (of course, the sides are immediately renamed after
    this, so the sequence still reads L1 L2 C1 C2 when code is
    generated).
  * *L1+L2 later >>* shifts both L1 and L2 to happen after C1 and C2. Thus, the new
    sequence would be C1 C2 L1 L2.
  * *L2 later >>* shifts L2 one step later, so the new sequence would be L1 C1 L2
    C2. While this may not be so common, it could be useful in some
    situations.

The set of choices available in this menu depends on the current sequence, and
on which side you are selecting to re-order.

* Click on the *Next* or *Prev* buttons to navigate between the different sides in
  this part
* Click on the *Bends* button to navigate down from the sides into the set of
  bends for this side (this is the converse of the *Side* button in the
  Bend panel that lets you navigate up from a bend to the side that
  contains the bend).
