= Tools/Machine tonnage check

== Does Flux check the tonnages of punches/dies and the machine?
Flux computesfootnote:[For the same part, you may sometimes notice that the 
computed tonnage is different when you switch to a different press-brake, 
even though you may be using similar punches and dies (with the same V-widths, 
angles and punch tip radii). The difference is because Flux has a few different 
_force computation_ algorithms, provided by different press-brake OEMs, 
and their results are not always exactly in agreement.] 
the press-force required to process each bend, and then uses this
to check that the punches, dies and adapters used for the bend are not overloaded.
Typically, tonnages for bend tools are specified as kN/m (kilo-newtons per meter)
or tons per meter. Flux computes the linear tonnage required for a bend and 
checks if this limit lies within the tools' limit load. When this is violated,
errors are displayed:

In addition, the total tonnage required for the bend is checked against the 
tonnage the machine can generate, and when the machine is overloaded, an error
is displayed in the *Ram* row of the bend navigator. 

The tool-tip generated for a punch or die shows the linear tonnage that the 
tool is capable of handling:

The tool-tip for a bend operation shows the overall tonnage that is required
to complete the bend:
