= Switching to Bend CAM
:imagesdir: img
:experimental:

If you have a 3D sheet metal model open, you can switch to Bend CAM using the 
Workflow panel. For example:

. Click on the *workflow* icon in the command bar on the left
. Click on the *Bend Tech* process node in the workflow panel (see the
  highlight in the image on the right). <u>Optional:</u> Click on the auxiliary icon
  to the right of the Bend Tech process node to select a different machine first.
. Click the *close* button to close the Workflow panel

Here is a faster way to do the steps above, using keyboard shortcuts:

. Press kbd:[W] to open the workflow panel
. Press kbd:[B] to switch to bending mode
. Press kbd:[Esc] to close the workflow panel

And here is an even quicker method that you can use, for the common case that
you want to simply use the same press-brake you used last time:

* Open a part (2D or 3D)
* Press the kbd:[B] key
* This switches to bend mode, computes a bending solution and generates the
  NC code and the setup sheet automatically. footnote:outputs[You can configure whether
  Bend NC code and/or a setup sheet are automatically generated when you switch
  to bending, using the `Settings > Bend CAM > Bend Outputs` page of the Settings dialog. 
  If there are any errors in the bend solution (part collisions, or incorrect 
  gauging), NC code is not automatically generated.]

== Generating Bend Outputs
When you switch to Bend-CAM, Flux analyzes the part, computes a bending sequence
and assigns tooling. In most cases, the results of this automatic processing will be a completed
bend-part which requires no further intervention. You can verify this by checking that the
bend technology status in the workflow panel reads _no errors_. Also, the 
xref:Navigator#[bend navigator] will have no alarm lights on.

If there are no errors, you can click further on the Post process bend part icon in
the workflow to generate the outputs from bending. These are typically a bending report
(containing a setup sheet) and the actual NC code for bending. By clicking on the icons
near the bend outputs node, you can view these outputs.

Once NC code has been generated, the NC code icon turns gray:

Subsequently, when any change is made to the part (for example, if you change the tooling,
the sequence or the gauging), the icon becomes _enabled_ again, reminding you that NC code
has not yet been generated for the changes you have just made:

== Switching to a different machine
When you use one of the methods described above, the part normally gets tooled up for 
the default machine (the same machine that was used the last time). To switch to a 
different machine:

* Click on the machine name in the part's tab on the bottom of the screen
* Pick the new machine from the list of bend machines installed (see image below)
* The part is re-sequenced and tooled for the new machine, and NC code is 
  generated if you have turned that on. footnote:outputs[]
