= Editing the Back-gauges
:imagesdir: img

The back-gauge positions for each bend can be adjusted by just clicking 
on the back-gauge - this opens the *Gauge* panel, which is shown alongside. 

== The Gauge Panel

* Use the *Gauge* selector to select the gauge you want to edit (you can also
  just click on the gauge, and the panel is displayed to edit that gauge.
* The *Z*, *X* and *R* inputs are used to adjust the position of the gauges
  in three dimensions. For most press-brakes, the axes are as indicated
  in the image below:footnote:[Depending on the press-brake in use, the names
  of these axes may be different.]

* The *Surface* selector is used to engage a different _surface_ of the
  gauging finger to the part. The set of surfaces available depends on the
  machine, and not all surfaces may be applicable for all bends (Flux will
  inform you when a particular surface cannot be used). The image below
  shows different surfaces being used:

* The *Retract* setting is used to set the gauge-retraction distance before
  bending. For some bends, the gauge has to be retracted (in the +X direction)
  by some distance after the part is _pinched_ by the punch, but before it is
  bent (to avoid a collision). This setting is used to control the retraction
  distance. When you are editing this, Flux actually retracts the gauge by 
  the specified amount as a preview, so you can judge whether the retraction
  may be sufficient.
* Use the *Auto-Place* button to ask Flux to compute a position automatically 
  for the specified gauge. In general, Flux will have multiple gauging possibilites,
  and repeatedly clicking the Auto-Place button will cycle through those 
  possibilities. To revert back to the _default_, close the gauge panel, click
  on the gauge again, and then click Auto-Place - the first position then 
  selected is the default (that would also be the result of the original 
  auto-sequencing and tooling).
* Use the *Flip Part* button to insert the other side of the part into the
  machine and compute gauging afresh. This is similar to the Flip Part 
  button in the xref:EditBend#[bend panel].

=== Editing gauging for multiple bends
It is possible to edit the gauge positions for multiple bends at the same time. 
To do this, first select multiple bends by Shift+Click on the bend numbers in
the bend navigator. Then, click on a gauge. The image alongside shows the gauge 
positions for bends 1, 2 and 4 being edited together:

image::edit-gauge3.png[Gauge Panel-3,float="right",width=247]

In this example, the bends all use the same Z position for the gauge, and
editing this position will adjust the Z position for all the gauges. The X and
R position values are blank, since they are different for each bend. You can,
however, type in an X or R value and it will be applied for all bends.

In general, you will rarely need to use this functionality. The gauge panel
is aware of the limitations of a particular press-brake and will enforce all
constraints required. For example, the R positions of the two gauges must be
the same for some machines (they do not have independent R1 and R2 axes) - Flux
will ensure that when you edit the R position for one gauge, the other one is
also adjusted immediately to track. 

For some machines with _2-axes_ gauging systems, the Z positions of the gauges
are set manually, and are not typically changing from bend to bend (since that
would involve the operator having to manually adjust the gauges after each bend).
For such machines, when Z position is set for one bend, it is set to the same
for all bends. The collision status, gauge-engaged status etc are computed for
all bends immediately, so it is very easy to find common Z1 and Z2 positions
that may be acceptable for all bends. 

== Dragging gauges
Though the exact gauging positions can be set by typing in Z, X and R values,
it is often more simple to position the gauges just by dragging them into 
contact with the part. 

* Click once to select the gauge you want to drag
* Click on the selected gauge and drag to position it. Depending on the
  _viewpoint_, the gauge is dragged along either a horizontal or vertical plane. 

Typically, you start with the gauge away from the part, and drag it towards the
part until it touches. You can continue dragging further (pushing the gauge _into_ the part), 
and a _wireframe_ will continue moving, but the actual gauge stops when it touches the part.

image::drag-gauge.png[Drag Gauge,width=768]

The image above shows this in operation - we start dragging the gauge towards
the sheet in the direction indicated by the arrow. As soon as the gauge touches
the sheet, it stops, and just a wireframe representation continues moving (to
show you where you are attempting to drag the gauge). This makes it easy to 
position the gauge so it is just touching the part without any gaps, and without
any collisions. 

In this image above, we are looking at the gauge from a viewpoint that is close to
_top down_. So, the gauge moves in the XZ plane, and the R value of the gauge is
kept constant. If you rotate the view to a more _end on_ view, the gauge will
move in the XR plane, and the Z value will be constant. 

=== Clamp-snaps while dragging
By dragging the gauge, it is easy to precisely position the gauges when 
you are using one of the *Stop* type surfaes. When youa are using one of the
*Clamp* type surfaces, this is more difficult, since you have to engage both
surfaces of a clamping finger against the part. 

Flux makes this easy by providing automatic _snaps_ when the gauge is close
to a possible _clamping position_. To use this mechanism, first rotate the view
so you are seeing the gauges from top-down. Then, drag the gauges so the corner
you want to clamp fits near the aperture of the fingers:

image::drag-gauge2.png[Drag Gauge-2,width=768]

The image above shows a clamping operation in progress. As we drag the gauges
close to a clamping position, they _snap_ into position at the Clamp 1 position
(see image above, center). Dragging further, the gauges then snap into the 
Clamp 2 position (see image above, right). Note that the R value of the gauge
is automatically adjusted up or down as we move to these different clamping snaps.
