= Editing a Bend
:imagesdir: img

Some basic settings for a bend can be viewed and edited by using the *Bend* panel. 
To bring up the bend panel for a particular bend:

* Click on a bend in the bend navigator to select the bend.
* Click *again* on the same bend to open the bend panel to edit that bend.

An alternative method:

* *Ctrl+Click* on a bend in the bend navigator, to select the bend and
  to open the editing panel for that bend.

== The Bend Panel

image::edit-bend.png[Bend Panel,float="right"width=136]

The Bend panel looks like the image alongside. This has some settings and operations for working
on the bend.

* The *Position* input is used to move the bend along the machine. The value displayed here is
  the position of the _left end_ of the bend on the machine's scale. (You can also drag the bend
  to interactively set the position, see the section below).
* The *Setup* and *Station* lists are used to move this bend-operation to a different 
  setup,footnote:[A *setup* is a complete assemblage of punches and dies on the machine; some 
  parts require multiple setups to be processed fully, and for such parts, Flux will 
  generate multiple NC codes (one for each setup).] or to a different 
  stationfootnote:[A *station* is an aligned set of punches and dies in a setup, used 
  to process a bend. Depending on the complexity of the part, some setups may contain 
  a number of stations positioned along the table of the machine. Different bends may
  be processed at different stations.] within this setup. These choices appear only if 
  the part has multiple setups, or if the setup has multiple stations, respectively. 
  (You can also move a bend to a different station by just dragging it there).
* The *Flip Part* button is used to _flip_ the part (insert it with the other side into 
  the machine). The image belows shows the effect of clicking this button (clicking it 
  again will restore the original orientation):

image::flip-part.png[Flip Part,align="center",width=561]

* The *Ungroup* button appears when you are editing a _multiple-span_ bend (a bend made of two
  or more collinear bending spans). If the grouped bend _can_ be ungrouped and processed as 
  separate bends, this button can be used to break this bend operation into two separate ones. 
  The image below shows how bend 1 (displayed as 1a and 1b in the sequencing mode) splits into
  bend 1 and 2 after ungrouping:

image::ungroup.png[Ungroup,align="center",width=552]
  
* The *Angle Measure* button is used to display the _angle-measurement panel_ for this bend. 
  This button is visible only if one or more angle measurement methods are available for the
  selected machine.
* The *Skip Bend* button is used to tell Flux not to process this particular bend. This is useful
  to mark some bends as being processed with a different technology than the press-brake (for 
  example, a punch-press or a panel-bender).footnote:[You can move a skipped bend to the 
  beginning or the end of the process sequence, depending on whether it should be treated 
  as _already done_ or _to be done later_. Setting this correctly will help Flux to do a 
  more accurate collision check.]

* Turn on the *Coining* check-box to tell Flux to use a coining operation. This is enabled only
  if a coining would be possible (typically, this means there is a coining-capable punch and
  die that can be used). Coining requires more press force, but can result in a tighter bending
  radius than an air-bending can. Coining also requires that you have a punch and die with the
  exact angle that is required for this bend operation. 
* Turn on the *Pre-bending* option to split this bend into two separate operations - a pre-bend,
  and the finishing bend. By default, Flux will move the finishing bend to a position that is just
  after the _next_ bend in the sequence. See the section below for more on using a 
  pre-bend.footnote:[Usually, Flux can determine automatically when a pre-bend can be used to 
  avoid such collisions, and will turn on the pre-bending option for such a bend. This switch 
  provides a manual override for this (to turn on/off a pre-bend).]
* Use the *Prev* and *Next* buttons to cycle through editing the different bends in the part.

== Using a pre-bend
Some types of collisions can be avoided by splitting a bend operation into a pre-bend and a
finishing bend. Here is a simple example:

image::pre-bend1.png[Die Collision,width=327]

The part above has two bends, and on the second bend the part collides with the die-rail. This
cannot be fixed by changing the sequence. One possible fix is to introduce a pre-bend at bend 1, 
by choosing bend 1 and turning on the *Pre-bending* check-box. 

image::pre-bend2.png[Pre-bending,width=367]

As can be seen in the image, this splits bend 1 into a pre-bend and a finishing-bend (which 
now becomes bend 3). The icons on the bend-navigator now indicate that bend 1 is a pre-bend,
while bend 3 is a finishing bend. You can use the *Prebend* input box to fine-tune the angle
of the pre-bend. In this example, the angle is set to 120, so the part is bent from the
flat state (180 interior angle) to 120 degrees in the first stage, and then to 90 degrees in
the second stage. Thus, during the processing of bend 2, the first flange is not fully bent, and
so avoids a collision with the die-rail (the images below show the situation when bends 2 and
3 are being processed):

== Dragging a bend
The *Position* input box can be used to position a bend precisely. Often, it is easier to 
just _drag_ a bend into the required position. To do this:

* Ensure the bend editing panel is open (by clicking twice on the bend number)
* Click on the part near the bend line and start dragging the part left/right

Depending on where you hold the part (near the center of the bend line, or near the the
left/right edges), Flux will generate automatic _snap lines_ that help you position the 
bend precisely with respect to a tool station. The image below shows a bend being dragged
by holding it near the center, or by holding it near the left edge.

image::drag-bend.png[Drag Bend,width=596]

The snap lines in the figures above show the bend being positioned exactly in the center 
of the tool station, or with the left edge aligned exactly with the punch and die.

== Editing multiple bends
It is possible to edit multiple bends at the same time. To do this:

* Click on a bend in the bend navigator to select it.
* Hold down the *Shift* key and select additional bends to edit them all together.

image::edit-bends.png[Edit Bends,float="right"width=106]

An editing panel like the one alongside is displayed. Some editing operations that
can be done on all the bends together are displayed here. In addition, this panel
may display some additional buttons:

* The *Group* button is displayed if you select two or more bends that are collinear
  and could be grouped together into a single multi-span bend operation. 
* The *Swap Bends* button is displayed when you select exactly two bends, and allows
  the two bends to be swapped in the sequence (this is displayed only if the two
  bends _can_ be swapped in the sequence).
* If the two bends are parallel, in opposite directions, and are a short distance 
  apart, it may be possible to combine them into a single _Z-Bend_. In this case, the
  *Make Z-Bend* button is displayed.footnote:[Usually, Flux can determine automatically
  if two such bends should be grouped into a single Z-bend (sometimes called an offset bend, 
  or a joggle bend) for processing. This switch exists for some situations where you want 
  to manually override that decision.]
