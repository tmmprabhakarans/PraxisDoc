= Editing Operations

There are several TODO[Clarity](../intro/clarity) _panels_ used to edit the settings of a
bend operation, the punch and die stations, the gauging or the angle-sensor configuration.
Most of these panels are accessed simply by clicking on the appropriate element in the
3D display - for example, to edit the die station settings, just click on the die mount.
