When you are editing a bend mount, you can click the *Setup* navigation button in the
tool mount panel to edit the complete bend setup. The Bend Setup panel is displayed alongside, 
and there are a few operations possible here.

* You can *Save* a setup to a bend-setup file (these are files with the extension *.bsetup).
  Later, you can use the *Load* option to load this setup for use with a different part.
  This is a simple, manual, way to use the same setup for multiple parts. 
* The *Pack Station* button appears if there are multiple stations in this setup, and 
  it can be used to _pack_ those stations closer, while still avoiding any collisions
  with bends being processed at adjacent stations. 
* The *Center Setup* button appears if the stations in this setup are not centered 
  in the machine's available table area.
* The *Prev* and *Next* buttons can be used to switch between different setups in 
  this part (if there are multiple setups). 
* Clicking on the *Mounts* navigation button will take you down one level, to editing 
  the first xref:EditMount#[tool mount] in this setup (it is the opposite of the *Setup* 
  navigation button in the tool mount panel).
