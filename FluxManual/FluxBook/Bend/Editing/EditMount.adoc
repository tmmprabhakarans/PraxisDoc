= Editing a Tool Mount
:imagesdir: img
:experimental:

When you click on a tool mount, the *Bend Mount* panel is displayed, and can be
used to edit various settings of the bend mount, and to perform several operations.

== The Bend Mount Panel

image::edit-mount.png[Bend Mount,float="right",width=136]

The Bend Mount panel looks like the image alongside. The exact settings and operations
available will vary, depending on whether you are clicking on a punch, die or 
adapter mount. In addition, some settings may be available or not depending on
machine capabilities

* Click the *Change Tool* button to replace the tool used for the selected mount
  with a different tool. (See the section below for more details on the _tool selector_
  that is used to select a replacement tool).
* The *Length* input is used to adjust the length of the station. When you type in
  a new value here, Flux will compose the station again using an appropriate set of
  _segments_ to try and match the requested length as closely as possible. You 
  can visually inspect the segments being used by looking at the segment boundary lines
  displayed on the bend mount.
* The *Position* input is used to set the position of the _left edge_ of the mount,
  along the machine's table or beam. The position can also be adjusted by _dragging_ 
  the mount left or right. (See the section below on dragging the mount).
* The *Ear* selector (displayed only for punch mounts) can be used to force Flux to
  use the left and/or right earfootnote:[These are sometimes also known as _shoulder_
  pieces] pieces in the composition).
* The *Flip Tool* button is used to flip the tool (front to back). It is displayed
  when you are editing a mount that uses an _assymmetric_ tool (like a gooseneck tool,
  for example). The flip operation is intelligent enough to figure out if additional
  holders and tools need to be flipped to maintain consistency. For example, in the
  image below, flipping the OW_Z4 punch (used for Z-bending) also flips the die, the
  holder and even the part to maintain process consistency:

image::flip-tool.png[Flip Tool,align="center",width=681]
  
* The *Add Gap* button is used to add a gap into the tool mount to allow a flange
  to pass through without collisions (see the section below on Adding a Gap for more
  details on this).
* The *Add Adapter* button is used to add an _extender_ to increase the height
  of the punch or die. When you add an adapter, the adapter become selected and
  the panel for the adapter is displayed (this allows you to change the actual adapter
  being used, or to remove it):

image::add-adapter.png[Add Adapter,align="center",width=533]

  * Click the *Remove* button to remove the tool mount. There will be a _missing punch_
  or _missing die_ error displayed in the bend navigator for bends that are using this
  station, and this can be fixed by using the *Add* button on the command bar on the 
  left to add a new mount.
* The *ACB Sensor* selector is used to cycle through the different ACB sensor disk
  pairs that can be used for this part. The selection depends on the sheet thickness,
  and the punch being used.

When you edit a tool mount using any of these settings and operations, Flux
immediately validates the status of all bend operations, performing various checks
like collision, tool usability etc. The bend navigator status updates immediately and
in real-time, making it very easy to experiment with various settings with immediate 
and accurate feedback. 

=== Navigation and selection
The bend-mount panel displays various buttons in the _navigation_ and _selection_
sub-panels. 

* Use the *Setup* navigation button to move up to editing the entire bend setup.
  See the xref:EditSetup#[setup editor] page for more details on this.
* Use the *Prev* and *Next* buttons to cycle through editing the different 
  tool mounts in this setup
* Use the *Segments* navigation button to move down one level and edit the 
  _individual segments_ making up this mount. The section below on editing tool-mount
  segments provides more information on this
* Use the *Tool Station* selector to select all the tool-mounts making up this 
  _station_. This will select all the punches, dies and holders that are aligned with
  the selected mount, so they can all be edited or moved together. 
* Use the *Same Tool* selector to select other tool mounts that use the same tool. 
  This is often useful before using a _tool change_ operation; selecting all the 
  stations using the specified tool broadens the available selection of replacement
  tools.footnote:[For example, if you are doing a *Change tool* operation on only 
  one punch station, and there are multiple punch stations, then you will be restricted 
  to choosing only other punch tools that are the _same height_, to avoid punch-die 
  collisions because of uneven gaps.]

== Editing tool-mount segments
image::edit-mount2.png[Segment editing,float="right",width=525]

Clicking on the *Segments* navigation button when a bend tool mount is being edited opens
up the _Tool Segment_ panel, which looks like the image alongside.

* The *Segment* selector is used to replace the selected tool segment with a longer or
  shorter piece, or a different type of piece. 
* The *< Shift* and *Shift >* buttons are used to shift the selected segment left or 
  right in the composition. This does not change the overall length of the composition,
  but is useful to move a gauging sensor piece left or right to avoid holes, for example.
* The *Add* and *Remove* buttons are used to add new segments into the composition, or
  to remove the selected segment out. 
* The *Prev* and *Next* navigation buttons are used to cycle through editing the different
  segments in the bend mount. As the image above shows, the tool segment being edited 
  is highlighted in blue. 
* The *Mount* navigation button is used to move up one level, and edit the entire bend
  mount, rather than individual segments. 

== Advanced editing operations
=== Adding a Gap
It is sometimes useful to add a narrow _gap_ in a tool mount, usually to allow a flange
to pass through without a collision. To do this, click on the *Add Gap* button (which appears
if the tool mount is long enough). A small section opens up in the panel, with a set of
inter-linked inputs to set the Left-margin, Right-margin and actual gap. Since the sum of
these three must add up to the tool mount length, editing two of these will set the third
one automatically. 

The image below shows this operation in progress. We have a flange that collides with the
punch, and we adjusting the Left/Right margins until the proposed gap is aligned with 
where the flange intersects the punch (you can see the proposed gap being displayed as
two orange lines traced on the bend-mount).

When you click ont he *Ok* button in this sub-panel, the gap is created and you can see
that the collision error is now resolved:

=== Using a double-V adapter
It is possible to use a double-V adapter to mount two dies next to each other. To do
this manually, use the *Add Adapter* button to add an adapter to a die, and then use
the *Change Tool* button to change that adapter to a double-V adapter. Now, it is possible
to add a second die to the other slot of the double-V adapter using the *Add* command
from the command-bar and choosing a die mount. 

When you have a die mounted one slot of a double-V holder, you can shift it to the
other slot by clicking on the *DV Shift* button that is displayed:

image::dv-shift.png[Double-V Shift,width=465]

=== Editing multiple mounts
image::edit-mounts.png[Multiple mounts,float="right",width=138]

If you select multiple mounts by using Shift+Click on all of them, they can be 
edited together. Only settings and operations that are common to all the mounts are
avilable for editing.

Fields such as *Length* or *Position* are displayed for editing, only if they are
the same for all the mounts. 

If you have multiple stations, it is useful to select all the punches or all the
dies before doing a *Change Tool* operation. In this case, the choice of available
replacement tools is more extensive (since there is no danger of different-height
punches and dies causing a collision).

== Dragging a bend-tool mount
image::drag-mount.png[Dragging a mount,float="right",width=455]

The *Position* input can be used to set a precise position for a mount. Sometimes,
it is easier to just drag a bend-mount to a new position. To do this:

* Click on the bend mount to select it (select multiple mounts using kbd:[Shift+Click])
* Click and start dragging left/right to move the selected mount. 

As the image above shows, when you move the mouse over a selected mount, the 
arrow-head is displayed indicating that you can drag the selected mount. When 
you are dragging the mount, snap indicators let you easily align the mount to 
other existing mounts.

If you _pick up_ a mount near its left edge, then the left edges of all mounts
are used for snapping. If you pick up a mount by the center, then the center-line
is used for snapping, and so on.

== The Replace Tool window
When you click on the *Change Tool* button, the *Replace Tool* window is displayed:

image::tool-replace.png[Tool replacer,width=700]

This window displays all the possible replacement tools. 

* Use the hierarchy on the left to narrow down the choices - for example, you could
  choose to display only Gooseneck tools, to make the selection easier. 
* Use the *Sort* selector on the top to sort the tools by name, height, radius or
  other sort criteria (the exact set of sort criteria depends on whether you are
  replacing a punch, die or adapter).
* You can type in a tool name (or short-name) into the *Search* box to quickly 
  narrow down the list. Typing in a partial tool name is fine too - using *OW200* 
  for example will match both OW200, OW200/S and OW200/K tools. 
* Use the *Scale* slider to adjust the sizes of the tool images. The tool that is
  currently used has a blue fill and a thick outline. The light-blue cross-hatch
  indicates _other tools_ that are used in this part. 
* Turn off the *Filter* check-box to have an unrestricted view of all tools (regardless
  of whether they are suitable or not). In this view, the tools that are not suitable
  are grayed out, and moving the mouse over one of these tools indicates _why_ it is
  not available for selection:

image::tool-replace2.png[Tool error,align="center",width=496]
  
As you move the mouse over the tool images, Flux _immediately_ re-computes the 
selected tool mounts using the newly selected tool, and you can see in real-time
whether the tool you are considering will cause any collision problems or not (the
corresponding bends in the bend-navigator will instantly light up in red if there
is a collision). This real-time preview makes it very easy for you to experiment
with various tool choices until you find one that works. 

If you *click* on one of the tools, the choice is made and the new tool is applied
to the part. If you press *Escape* instead, the preview choices you made are 
reverted back and the original tool is left unchanged.
