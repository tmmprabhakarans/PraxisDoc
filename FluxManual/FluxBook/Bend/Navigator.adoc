= The Bend Navigator
:imagesdir: img

When you are in the _bending view_, the *Bend Navigator* panel appears along the top
edge of the Flux window. This navigator provides a quick way to navigate
through various bend operations, and also an instant view into various
status-checks for every bend. It provides controls to view or stop the
folding simulation. Here is an example of how the bend navigator looks:

image::nav1.png[Navigator 1,width=50%]

The navigator displays different colors for bends that have some warnings or
errors. The current bend is displayed with an outlined box, and the small dots
that appear in each of the boxes indicate the _tool station_ in which the
bend is processed.footnote:[These dots are displayed only if the part has more than
one station]

== Simulation controls

When you move the mouse near the fold navigator, *simulation controls* appear.

image::nav2.png[Navigator 2,width=50%]

* The *slider* can be used to move the current bend through various phases of the
  bending operation (insert part for bending, retract back-gauges
  move punch to pinch point, press with beam to bending position, etc). As the slider is moved, the
  tool-tip displays the current phase of bending, and various parts of
  the machine move in the simulation. If there are any collisions, those
  parts are colored red to clearly highlight the collision.  
* The *play controls* near the left can be used to start the simulation, stop it,
  or rewind to the beginning. (*Tip*: You can also press the *Spacebar* to
  start or stop playing the fold simulation).
* The downward facing chevron near the middle can be used to expand the fold
  navigator, displaying more detailed information about the errors and
  warnings for various bends. (*Tip*: you can also press the *Z* key to
  expand/collapse the fold navigator display).

== Bend navigator: expanded view

When you open the bend navigator by clicking the open button, or by pressing the
*Z* key, this is how it looks:

image::nav3.png[Navigator 3,width=50%]

For each bend, the navigator now displays a several rows of status icons. Each colored
icon represents an error or a warning. Moving the mouse over the colored
cell displays some more information about what the error or warning is (as
you can see in the picture above).

Clicking on an cell that displays an error positions the simulation so that the
error is immediately obvious. For example, clicking on a cell that
displays a *punch-crash* error moves the simulation to the stage of the
simulation where the punch crashes with the workpiece.

=== The *Punch* row
The _Punch_ row of the bend navigator displays information about the punch
used for this bend, and shows if there are any punch-related warnings or errors.
These the icons that you might see in the Punch row:

|===

As you make changes to the punch, die, sequence, or gauge configurations, the
bend navigator is immediately updated with the new status. This immediate feedback
makes it easy to experiment with different configurations without having to issue a
*recompute* command each time.
