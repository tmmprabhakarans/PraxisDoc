Flux is an Integrated Sheet-metal CAM application. Using Flux, you can convert your sheet
metal designs into CAM data, which can be used to drive various types of sheet-metal NC
machines. Flux can generate code for a large number and variety of sheet-metal
machinery, including:

* Press-brakes
* Panel bending machines
* Laser machines

By providing a unified environment from which you can program all these different types of
machines, Flux makes it possible to use a single CAM application to control all the
sheet-metal machinery on your shopfloor. Flux can also integrate with
Metamation's *Praxis* system for doing advanced resource planning,
shop-floor management and large-volume batch processing.
