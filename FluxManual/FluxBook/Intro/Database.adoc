* The panel on the right shows the list of all the available machines. Expand the tree to
  pick the machine you want to install, and then click on the *Install* button to install
  the machine. 
* The panel at top left shows the list of _installed_ machines. Select a machine to edit the 
  settings for that machine. The exact list of settings will vary depending on the machine
  selected. One setting that is common for all machines is the *Nickname* that you can set
  for each machine. This is the name that is displayed when the machine is referenced in 
  the Flux user interface.
* You can select a installed machine, and click on the *Remove* button to uninstall it. 
  (Flux confirms if you really want to remove the machine).

When you install a new machine, that machine gets selected as the default machine, so you
can immediately test it out.
