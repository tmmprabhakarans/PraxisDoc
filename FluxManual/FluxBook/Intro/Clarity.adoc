= The Clarity Interface
:imagesdir: img
:experimental:

Flux uses an innovative user interface design, code-named *Clarity*. When you are 
working in Flux, you are presented with an uncluttered, minimalist view.

image::clarity.png[Clarity,651]

In the Flux interface, you will *not* find:

* Many rows of stacked icons, with only a small number being relevent to the current context.
* Deep menu structures with dozens of menus.
* User-interface _ribbons_ taking up a lot of space on the top of the screen.

Instead, the Clarity interface works on the principle of *Select*, then *Operate*. 

* Select things by clicking on them.
* A Clarity Panel pops-up, containing various *Settings* and *Operations* for the selected thing.
* The Panel often contains some controls for *Extending* the selection by selecting other similar things.
* The Panel often also contains controls for *Navigating* among the various things you are working with.

These user-interface principles are consistent across every working mode of Flux. Whether you 
are cleaning up a 3D model, arranging parts on a nested sheet, or editing press-brake 
tooling, you will use the same set of key concepts. To make these abstract ideas 
more concrete, let us take a small excursion and see the Clarity interface in 
action (we will take examples from the Flux report editor and also from 
Flux Bend to illustrate).

== A Guided Tour

This is a quick tour of how the Clarity interface works. There are just a 
handful of simple concepts that are repeated everywhere in Flux, and understanding 
these concepts will mean that most of Flux can be used without much reading 
or training. In other words, if you read this section, you could skip reading 
the rest of the Flux user guide!

== A Sample Report

You can learn more about creating and editing report templates in a later section. 
For now, let us introduce some report terminology so we can use this to 
illustrate concepts of the Clarity interface.

image::report.png[Report,574]

The image above shows some of the types of entities that could be placed in a report.

* A *Label* is a simple piece of text; you can set various properties like the font, 
  text-alignment and the color.
* A *Field* displays some actual data picked up from the underlying Part 
* A *Shape* is some simple geometry (like an ellipse, rectangle or line) that can be used to 
  add back-drops, highlights or dividers in a report.
* A *Table* displays data from the underlying Part that has a tabular form 
  (like a spread-sheet of information). In this example, we can see a list of bend operations 
  in this part, and some attributes are displayed for each of them. 

With this basic background about report entities, we can now begin exploring the *Clarity* interface.

=== Principle: Click on something to edit it

Click on a Field, and a *Clarity Panel* is displayed (let's just call this a 
Panel in this discussion). Here's an annotated diagram of how it could look :

image::fieldpanel.png[Field Panel,581]

Clicking on a field selects it and displays a Panel for editing it. 
Here are some of the elements we see in this panel:

* The caption bar can be used to re-position the panel (you can actually click 
  anywhere on the background of the panel and drag it). If you set the *push-pin*
  in, then panels always open at that location on the screen. Else, panels open 
  close to the location of the mouse cursor.
* Edit boxes, number input boxes, choice lists, font and alignment selectors are 
  all various ways in which the settings of the Field are viewed and edited.
* Action buttons are how various operations are performed on the selected object. 
  In this case, one could delete the field from the report by clicking on 
  the Delete button
* Some Panels may contain a large number of elements. To reduce clutter, the panels 
  are divided into sections, using *Expanders*. In the image above, you can see 
  the *Visual* expander is closed (hiding all the settings in that section), while 
  the Font expander is open . You can click anywhere on the expander to open or 
  close a section.

=== Principle: Select multiple things and edit them together

You can select additional entities by holding down the kbd:[Shift] key when you click on them. 
When multiple entities are selected, a Panel is displayed that allows you to edit 
the settings of all of them at the same time.

image::multisel1.png[Multiple Selection,443]

In the image above, we have 3 fields that we selected using the kbd:[Shift+Click] mechanism. 
The panel that is displayed allows us to edit the settings of all these three fields 
at the same time. (Here we have the *Visual* expander open and the *Font* expander closed). 
After editing the *Bgrd* color and the *Pen-width* settings, here's how the report looks:

image::multisel2.png[Multiple Selection 2,311]

The changes we made are applied to all the selected items. In this multiple-edit 
scenario, note that the *Expression* setting is not displayed; this is one 
of the settings that we are unlikely to want to edit together for a set of 
fields (we would not really want 3 fields displaying the same value from the Part). 
Settings which would usually have distinct values for each entity are not displayed 
in such group-editing panels.

=== Principle: You can edit entities of different types together

In the example above, we selected three entities of the same type. What happens if 
we select entities of different types? Let us see. First, here is how the panel 
for a *Shape* entity looks:

image::multisel3.png[Shape Panel,398]

If we select a *Field* and a *Shape* at the same time, this is the panel that is displayed:

image::multisel4.png[Field and Shape,395]

* The caption bar now reads *2 Report Items* since we are editing report items, 
  but not of the same type. 
* Only the common settings between *Field* and *Shape* are displayed (in this case, 
  these are just the settings in the Visual section). 

=== Principle: Multiple-selection may provide additional operations

In addition to the common subset of settings and operations available on multiple 
objects, multiple-selection may sometimes present new operations or settings 
that are not available on individual objects. Let us take an example from the 
bending view to illustrate this. In the bend view, clicking on a bend displays 
a panel to edit the settings of the bend and perform some operations on it:

image::bend1.png[Bend,409]

The image above shows the panel for bend 3. Let us now hold down kbd:[Shift]
and select bend 4 as well. The panel that is now displayed looks like this:

image::bend2.png[2-Bends,410]

There are some settings that we can edit in common (the skip bending setting or 
the station number setting). However we see a new button here called *Group*. 
Since two bends are selected, and these are collinear, they could be 
grouped into a single bend operation. This is detected automatically, and this 
new *Group* button is displayed; this operation is not available when just a 
single bend is selected. Clicking on that button groups the two bends together, 
as you can see in the image below.

image::bend3.png[Grouped,412]

Now, there are only 3 bend operations in this part. Also, bend 3 is now a 
_grouped_ bend and you see a new button appear: *Ungroup*

=== Principle: Use the Selection sub-panel to modify the selection

A Clarity panel will often have a *Selection* sub-panel near the bottom. 
This panel provides some buttons to modify the selection in various ways. 
Usually, there are buttons to select more objects that are similar in some way 
or the other. For example, some ways to expand the selection would be:

* Select all Fields in a report
* Select all polylines in the same layer
* Select all punch-hits in a part that use the same punch tool
* Select all bends that use the same setup

Here is an example from the report editor of a selection panel being displayed 
when we click on a Field in a report:

image::selection.png[Selection,303]

The selection sub-panel has a distinctive patterned background and rounded buttons. 
In this example, you can see buttons to select all fields, select all 
*Bend* fields (fields related to bend CAM data), and to toggle the current 
selection set.

The actual list of selection buttons displayed in this sub-panel will vary 
depending on the context. You will find that most common scenarios are handled 
very conveniently by these selection buttons.

=== Principle: Use the Navigation sub-panel to walk through the entity tree

The set of entities in a part, report or layout often have a hierarchical structure. 
We call this the _Entity Tree_. The structure is typically represented like an 
upside-down tree, with the 'parent' object at the top and children below it. 
Here's an example of an entity tree in a report.

* A report could have multiple items within it. Some of these items could be Tables
* A Table in a report could have multiple Columns in it.

Thus, there are 3 levels in this tree, and a graphical representation of this 
tree could be as follows:

image::navigate1.png[Navigate,768]

This report has 2 Labels, 1 Field and 1 Table. The Table has 4 columns. 
When we click on the table, we see a panel like this:

image::navigate2.png[Table,619]

The navigation panel provides directional navigation buttons to walk through the 
entity tree. Like the selection panel, the navigation sub-panel has a distinctive 
textured background, and appears at the bottom of the panel, but just above the 
selection sub-panel.

The *Prev* and *Next* buttons move among items at the same level of the entity tree. 
Thus, clicking these buttons would select the other items in the report, such as 
the *Label* or the *Field* items in the report.

Clicking the up navigation button (titled *Report* in this example) would move 
up from the table to the parent - the _Report_ itself. The panel that is displayed 
when you click on the *Report* button shows some settings related to the report 
itself, such as the paper size and the margins:

image::navigate3.png[Report,617]

Now we are editing the report; we are the root of the entity tree. There is no 
direction to go but down, and thus the navigation sub-panel has just one button 
to go down to the list of items. Clicking this selects the table again.

From the table, the down navigation button (titled *Columns*) moves us down one 
level and puts us in column-editing mode. This is what happens when we click 
the Columns (down) navigation button from the table panel:

image::navigate4.png[Columns,613]

The settings for the selected column in the table are displayed. Clicking the 
*Prev* or *Next* buttons now moves the selection between the _columns_ in the 
table, since that is the level in the tree we are working with. There is 
no down navigation button, since this is the lowest level in the tree. 
The up navigation button (titled *Table* here) moves up one level, and we are 
back to editing the entire table.
