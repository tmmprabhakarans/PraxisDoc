== Preparing to install Flux

=== System requirements

* One of the following operating systems. Note
that Windows 7 requires Service Pack 1 to be installed, otherwise Flux cannot work on Windows 7.
  ** Windows 7 SP1, 64-bit (Windows 7 SP1 is supported with Extended Security Updates installed)
  ** Windows 8.1, 64-bit
  ** Windows 10, 64-bit
  ** Windows 11, 64-bit
* 8 GB RAM (16 GB recommended)
* 1024 x 768 screen resolution (1920 x 1080 recommended)
* Graphics card with OpenGL 4.0 support (Nvidia discrete GPU recommended)
* 3-button mouse or trackball

=== Pre-requisite software
The following pre-requisite software is required, and will be installed by the Flux installer
automatically, if it is not found:

* Visual C++ 2005 SP1 Redistributable (x86)
* Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable (x86)
* Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable (x64) – only on 64-bit platforms
* Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable (x64) – only on 64-bit platforms
* Microsoft .Net Framework 4.7.2
* Microsoft .Net 6.0.1

== Installing Flux

Run *FluxSetup.exe* (the exact filename may be different, and may include the revision number or 
date). If the pre-requisites (such as the .Net Framework) are not already installed, installation may 
take up to 15 minutes to complete. If the pre-requisites are already installed, installation should 
take about 1 or 2 minutes.

Follow the instructions to install Flux. This install process will place a short-cut to the Flux 
application on your desktop, and in the start menu. You can also start the application by running the
*Flux.exe* program directly.

=== Running Flux
When you run Flux for the first time, a language selector pops up and you can select the language 
used for Flux. (Depending on your installation, you may see a different set of languages here).

The language you choose here is used for Flux, and this can subsequently be changed by clicking on 
the *language* on the command bar. (This icon appears when you start Flux, and when you have 
had no parts open).
