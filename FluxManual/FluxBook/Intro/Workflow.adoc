= Part Workflow
:imagesdir: img
:experimental:

Since Flux has many integrated modules, there are often multiple _paths_ through
which part data can move.

*Example 1*: when you load flat part data (from a GEO file or DXF file), you could
choose to

* Assign laser tooling to the part, so it can be placed on a sheet and cut,
  along with other parts
* Fold the part along the bend lines into a 3-D part, so it can be processed and
  a bending sequence computed for a press-brake.

*Example 2*: when you import a 3-D surface model (from an IGES or STEP file), you
could choose to

* Analyze the surfaces and place 5-axis laser CAM tooling along holes that need
  to be cut
* Do feature recognition, convert the surface model to a sheet-metal model, and
  unfold it to a flat-pattern for punching out with a punch-press

== The Workflow Panel
image::workflow1.png[Workflow 1,float="right",width=248]

The Workflow panel is like a central hub from where you can direct all these
movements. When you have a part open, you can always bring up the workflow
panel by just pressing the W key, or clicking on the workflow icon in the
command bar on the left. Let us explore the workflow panel; start by
importing a 2D part with bending information (a GEO file, for example).
Bringing up the workflow panel at this point shows this:

* We started with Bend_28.geo, imported and cleaned up to create a 2D
  sheet-metal part (the part dimensions are displayed)
* There is then a branch in the workflow. 1. We could assign Laser Tech to the
  part (this simply means assignment of laser cutting paths to the part
  contours). 2. We could fold the flat part to 3D (9 bends are detected).

=== Expanding workflow nodes: Stage 1
Click on the Laser Tech icon to assign laser tooling to the part. You will see
the part is immediately analyzed and laser tooling is added to it. Then,
click on the Fold to 3D icon to fold the flat part into 3D. After these
steps, this is how the workflow panel looks:

image::workflow2.png[Workflow 2,698]

As the annotations show, there are different types of nodes in the workflow
diagram.

* There are Part View nodes representing the various types of processing one
  could do on the part. Clicking on these nodes switches the part to
  that _view_ and the set of operations available on the part is
  representative of that view. For example, in the Laser Part view, you
  can see and edit the laser tooling assigned to the part.
* You can switch between these view by clicking on these icons. All these various
  part views also have short-cut keys, which you can see if you just point
  the mouse at one of the view icons. Learn these short-cut keys to quickly
  navigate through the workflow. So, after a while, you will be using key
  sequences like kbd:[W] kbd:[B] kbd:[Esc] to open the
  workflow panel, switch to part to bending view, then close the workflow
  panel.
* The part data is pushed between these nodes by various processes, and these
  processes are represented in the workflow panel using the 13-pointed
  star icons. For example, you move from the 2D Part view to the Laser
  Part view by the Laser Tech process (which analyzes the 2D part and
  assigns laser tooling to it).

Processes you have completed have a check mark displayed inside them. Processes
you still have not completed (but which are available) have a cross
displayed inside. You can click on these process nodes to complete the
process.

Let us summarize what we can see at this stage of our partâ€™s workflow:

* There are 3 part views available now (the 2D Part, the Laser Part and the 3D
  Model that we can switch between).
* There four further processes available:
  ** We could Post Process Flat Part (this generates a flat-part report that would
     be useful to a laser or punch-press operator; it would typically
     include laser cutting times, tooling setup for punch presses and
     other special tooling requirements for this part)
  ** We could do a Quick-Nest (a quick-nest is a nest that contains only one type
     of part) and generate a full-sheet packed with this part. This
     could be used for producing a sheet full of just this part, or as
     to assist in making a quick cost or time estimate for this part.
  ** We could assign Bend Tech (press-brake tooling) for the part.
  ** We could assign Weld Tech (welding robot tooling) for the part.

=== Expanding workflow nodes: Stage 2

Let us go further: Click on all the available process nodes one at a time, and
see how the workflow panel expands. Keep going until you have no more
nodes left. Here's how it should look after these processes :

image::workflow3.png[Workflow 3,542]

In this fully expanded state, the workflow panel makes it easy for you to
instantly switch between six different views of the part in various
processing modules. You can also view and transmit or print all the
various outputs generated by these modules. (Outputs could be reports, NC
code, or time-studies).

== Navigating the work-flow panel
The workflow panel represents a lot of information and operations in a compact,
graphical form. Much of them time, this will serve as your central hub as
you are working with parts. Let us look a bit more closely at some of the
icons in the work-flow panel to understand how they can be used.

=== *Available* process nodes
A 13-pointed star with a + inside it represents a processing step that is now
available. For example, it could be the folding of a 2-D flat into a 3-D
part, or assignment of laser-technology tooling. Moving the mouse over
such a node displays a tool-tip that explains what the node will do.

image::workflow4.png[Workflow4, 260]

This follows a typical pattern for many Available process nodes. Clicking on the
node will execute the process with default settings. A kbd:[Ctrl+Click] on the
node brings up a settings page first, and after you review/edit the
settings, the process is carried out. For example, here is what comes up,
when you kbd:[Ctrl+Click] on the Quick-Nest node:

image::workflow5.png[Workflow5, 510]

The quick-nest settings are displayed so you can edit them before doing the
nest.

=== *Completed* process nodes
Once a process is completed, the node changes from an available process node to
a completed process node; the symbol becomes a star with a check mark
inside it. At this point, the options available for that node change.

image::workflow6.png[Workflow 6,428]

This is a typical set of options available on a completed process node. Clicking
the node brings up the process settings again, so you can tweak them and
try the processing again. A kbd:[Ctrl+Click] option is also usually available to
delete the process data. If you choose this option, you are prompted
before the deletion is carried out. For example, here is what happens when
you kbd:[Ctrl+Click] on the 3D Model node, for a fully processed part:

image::workflow7.png[Workflow7, 641]

== Auxiliary commands
Many nodes have small icons near them, providing auxiliary commands. These
commands provide some functionality that is related to that node. Here are
some examples.

* The auxiliary icons near each technology node typically allow you to select a
  different machine and tool up for that machine. +
  image:workflow8.png[Workflow 8,440]
  
* The icon near the Quick-nest node lets you nest at a different sheet size

* Icons near the output nodes let you view the various outputs from a processing
  node (reports, NC-code or time-studies). + 
  image:workflow9.png[Workflow 9, 324]

== Source file tracking
image::srcfiletrack.png[Source File Tracking,float="right",width=257]

Most processing in Flux starts by importing CAD data (either 2-D or 3-D). The
Flux parts that are built from this CAD data can continue to track these
source parts. When a part is opened, Flux can check if the original CAD
file from which it was created has been changed in the meanwhile. If it
has, the part is now out-of-date and this can be seen in the workflow
panel.

* You can choose to refresh the part by clicking on the refresh part auxiliary
  icon near the source part node. Flux will re-import the CAD geometry
  and rebuild the part.
* You can also choose to stop tracking the original CAD geometry. This might be
  useful, for example, if the original CAD file exists on a removable
  medium or on a remote drive that may not be accessible in the future.
  To do this, click on the break-link auxiliary icon near the source
  part node. This will bring up a prompt to stop tracking the source
  file: +

Batch processing
----------------
image:batch1.png[Batch File Processing,float="right", width=351]

The workflow panel offers a powerful batch processing option that can be used to
process a large number of parts with a similar workflow. These are the
steps to batch-process a set of parts:

* Open a number of parts that should be processed with a similar workflow (you
  can use the *File/Open* command to open multiple parts - just select all
  the files you want to open, even if they are of different file types).
* Use the workflow panel on any one of the parts, and process the part through
  all the way to generating outputs (there could be multiple outputs,
  for example a panel-bender program and a welding program).
* When the outputs are generated for this part, a new button called *repeat*
  appears at the top right of the workflow panel. (This appears only if
  there are multiple parts open already).
* Clicking on the *repeat* button brings up the Bulk process panel. This displays
  thumbnails of all the parts that are going to be processed, along with
  a brief summary of the batch processing operations that are going to
  be done on these parts.
* The image below shows the thumbnails of the parts (some of these parts are
  loaded from 2D files, and some from 3D files). Click on the process
  button to apply the workflow to all the parts. +
  image:batch2.png[Batch 2, 669]  
* After the processing is complete, the part thumbnails are updated:
  ** Parts that are correctly processed are in gray.
  ** Parts that were processed, but have some warnings that might require attention
    are shaded yellow (NC code is generated for these parts).
  ** Parts that could not be fully processed are shaded red.
* The image below shows the results after processing. Only some of the parts now
  require attention, and you can close all the perfectly completed parts
  by clicking on the Close Finished Parts link on the top-right of the
  bulk process window

image::batch3.png[Batch 3,669]  
  
== Summary
Here's a quick summary of the principles in the work-flow panel.

* The work-flow panel displays nodes representing various part views (such as
  laser part, bend-part) and nodes representing various processes (like
  fold-to-3D, assign-laser-tooling).
* Process nodes that are available (not yet carried out) are represented as
  13-pointed stars with + signs inside them. Process nodes that are
  already completed are represented by stars with a check-mark inside
  them.
* Clicking on an available process node invokes that process with default
  settings. kbd:[Ctrl+Click] on an available process nodes brings up an editor
  to edit the process settings first, and then invokes the process.
* Clicking on a completed process node lets you tweak the process settings and
  apply the processing again. kbd:[Ctrl+Click] on a completed process node
  removes the processing data.
* The small auxiliary icons near a process node, or a part-view node provide
  control to change some important parameter of that process node (such
  as the target machine, or the nest sheet size).
